  entryText: "These tools. Those stamps. Innocent, Infected. You\u2019ve found yourself
    in quite the powerful position, haven\u2019t you? The one who decides who lives
    and who dies.The judge and the gatekeeper. What does that make you if not God?"
  infectedText: "Keep choosing based on that silly little paper. Ever wonder who
    wrote it? Someone from the inside, I\u2019ll bet. Just make sure you put the
    bodies somewhere you can\u2019t see us."
  acceptedText: People die no matter which way you choose. The lesser of two evils,
    or just two roads with the same destination
